  ## Description
  This application is CMS-style blog site, similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This is our first full-stack application for the course.
  <br>

  For my application, I used the following technologies: This application utilizes mySQL, NodeJS, Sequelize, Express, Heroku, and Insomnia, along with JavaScript, JSON, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and more..
  <br><br>
  Some of the challenges I faced in creating this app included using Handlebars for the first time, getting the routes right,  figuring out how to add comments (something we hadn't done in class), and deploying to Heroku. 
  <br><br>
  In the future, I would like to develop this further to add pictures, including a profile picture and other user information.
